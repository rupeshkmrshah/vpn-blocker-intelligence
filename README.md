## FAQs

### 1. **How does the VPN detection work?**

The plugin uses the **ProxyCheck.io** API (if configured) to detect VPNs, proxies, and anonymizing services by checking the user's IP address. If a match is found, the plugin blocks or redirects the user based on your settings.

### 2. **How do I get my API key from ProxyCheck.io?**

To get your own API key, go to [ProxyCheck.io](https://proxycheck.io) and sign up for an account. After registration, you can generate your API key, which can then be entered into the plugin’s settings.

### 3. **Can I customize the message shown to VPN users?**

Yes, the plugin allows you to enter a custom message that will be displayed to users detected as coming from VPN networks or proxy IPs. You can personalize this message to match the tone and style of your website.

### 4. **Can I block VPN users only on specific pages or posts?**

Yes, the plugin provides the ability to block VPN users only on specific pages or posts. You can select which pages/posts to restrict from the settings page in your WordPress dashboard.

### 5. **What happens if I don’t enter an API key?**

If you choose not to use a ProxyCheck.io API key, the plugin will rely on its internal VPN detection methods. However, using an API key provides more accurate and real-time results.

### 6. **How can I whitelist trusted users or IP ranges?**

You can whitelist specific IPs to ensure trusted users are not blocked, even if they are using a VPN. Similarly, you can blacklist IPs to prevent known bad actors from accessing your site.
